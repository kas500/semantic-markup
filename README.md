# Semantic markup project. Homework 1

## Description

There are close to 8 billion people in the world. According to World Health Organization, there are over one billion people with disabilities. That is about 15 % of the population. Access to information is a human right. As web developers, we often think that what can be used, accessed and understood by us, also is good enough for others.<br /> **The main goal of this project is to study the basic principles of using the semantic elements of the HTML.**
